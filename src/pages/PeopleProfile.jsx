    bio: "Clea von Chamier-Waite, Ph.D. (aka Clea T. Waite) is an internationally exhibited intermedia artist, scholar, engineer, and experimental filmmaker investigating the material poetics that emerge at the intersection of art, science, and technology. She is a pioneer of immersive, cinematic artworks engaging embodied perception, dynamic composition, and sensual interfaces – and one inter-species collaboration with several hundred tropical spiders. Her multidisciplinary practice is modeled on the experimental laboratory, combining research, art-making, and scientific collaborations. Waite’s research encompasses the areas of science-art as media-specific practice; spatial cinema/ immersive cinema, including: 360°-cinema, fulldome, multi-channel video installation, and alternative and emerging screen technologies; embodied form and somatic interfaces; xr/vr; experimental cinema; and data poetics. Her projects thematically examine climate change, water ecology, astronomy, particle physics, feminism, and popular culture.\n\nWaite received her PhD from the University of Southern California in Media Arts + Practice, School of Cinematic Arts. She received her SMVis from the MIT Media Lab, 3D Computer Graphics and Animation Group, and her SB from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Architecture, in Physics and Electrical Engineering.\n\nWaite’s artworks have been exhibited and awarded internationally, notably the National Academies Keck Futures Initiative, IBM Innovation Prize for Artistic Creation in Art and Technology, Ars Electronica, SIGGRAPH, The China-Hangzhou Biennale of Art and Technology, the GC3 at the Miraikan National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, the Lumen Prize, and the Open Sky Project for ICC Hong Kong. Waite’s fellowships include an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Fellow, a Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies Fellow, CERN European Laboratory for Particle Physics artist-in-residence, ISEA AiR, Artists-in-Labs HKGZ, and fellow at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne.",

        description: "“Dong Xuan” reinterprets the classic German fairy tale, Hansel and Gretel, blending physical, geographical, digital, and linguistic landscapes. Named after a Berlin-based Vietnamese market, inspired by Vietnam’s largest indoor market in Hanoi, the video captures performances within a culturally hybrid space. Performers of German-Asian heritage traverse an ersatz forest of synthetic plants, reflecting a melding of worlds. The production integrates artificial intelligence, reimagining transitions, cuts, and the notion of cultural artificiality. Processed through an AI neural network, the footage undergoes a transformation where images degrade and morph into each other, symbolizing a journey through digital limbo. Embracing Legacy Russell’s concept of glitching, “Dong Xuan” challenges the structural norms of technology, consequently disrupting the social and cultural norms upheld by these systems. The glitches not only mirror the characters’ disorientation as they wander into an abstract, latent space but also signify the blurring boundaries in an increasingly digital future. The film’s geopolitical scrambling of site, place, people, and time not only offers insights into navigating and interpreting histories but also demonstrates how new technologies can obscure yet illuminate the complex networks of our diverse narratives and cultures.",

Unlike the previous iteration, which focused on power dynamics, this version places greater emphasis on the intimate meaning embedded in the gesture of hair combing. The work invites audience participation: viewers can experience having their hair combed by a robot arm. This robot arm does not act autonomously—it is remotely controlled in real time by a human operator, whose own wrist and hand movements are mirrored by the machine. This gives rise to a subtle question: is it the machine that is combing the participant’s hair, or is it the distant operator? In this piece, distance carries particular significance. The operator is located in Shanghai, China, and controls the combing machine in Sydney via a real-time connection, performing an act of \"overseas combing.\" Comb Machine 2025 asks: When people are separated by great distances, can an interaction that would typically signify closeness still retain its intimacy? When a fundamentally interpersonal gesture is mediated—translated—through a robotic interface, does its nature change?",

This juxtaposition research investigates how thermal imaging equalizes identity across human and non-human boundaries. Drawing from neuroscientific understanding of pareidolia and contemporary art practices that challenge anthropocentric vision, this project demonstrates that thermal signatures dissolve traditional taxonomic boundaries through shared heat patterns and create a universal language that transcends visible perceptions.",
